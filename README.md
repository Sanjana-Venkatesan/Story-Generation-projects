# Story Generation Projects

Welcome to the **Story Generation Projects** repository! This collection features various Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to create, refine, and customize story generation systems. These projects are designed to help you generate creative stories using AI by either taking user inputs or fine-tuning models for more specific outputs.

### Projects Overview:

1. **Image-Based Story Generator (`Image_based_story_generator.ipynb`)**  
   - This project explores the integration of **image-based input** with AI story generation. Users can upload images, and the system generates stories that are related to the content or themes of the image. The goal is to bridge the gap between computer vision and natural language processing by using image recognition as a prompt for storytelling.

2. **Story Generation Taking User Input (`story_gen_taking_user_input.ipynb`)**  
   - In this notebook, a story generation model is developed to take **user inputs** such as characters, settings, or specific plot elements. The system then generates a creative story based on the information provided by the user, allowing for interactive storytelling where users can influence the narrative.

3. **Story Generator Fine-Tuning (`story_generator_finetuning.ipynb`)**  
   - This project focuses on **fine-tuning a pre-trained model** to improve the quality of story generation. The idea is to refine the model on a specific dataset or theme to ensure that the generated stories are more relevant or aligned with the user's needs. This is an advanced project that involves customizing AI models to create more accurate and coherent stories.

4. **Story Generation Basics (`stry_gen.ipynb`)**  
   - A basic introduction to story generation, this notebook lays the groundwork for understanding how to create simple story generation systems. It includes basic techniques for using pre-trained models for generating short narratives or creative writing, making it a great starting point for beginners.

### Technologies Used:
- **Natural Language Processing**: Hugging Face Transformers, GPT-3/4, or other LLMs for story generation
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, Pillow (for the image-based story generation project)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Fine-Tuning Models**: Transfer learning, model fine-tuning on specific datasets
- **Text Generation Algorithms**: GPT, BERT, or other text generation models

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Storytelling**: Projects like **Story Generation Taking User Input** allow users to customize the story's input, making the experience interactive and personalized.
- **AI-Powered Creativity**: Leveraging pre-trained models like GPT, this repo demonstrates how AI can be used to create engaging and creative stories.
- **Image Integration**: The **Image-Based Story Generator** project merges computer vision and NLP to generate stories based on visual cues.
- **Model Customization**: **Story Generator Fine-Tuning** shows how you can improve the quality of AI-generated content by fine-tuning models for specific needs.

### How to Use:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the notebooks to explore different story generation approaches.
4. Modify or experiment with the models for specific use cases (e.g., incorporating user-specific themes or images).
5. Use the interactive elements in the notebooks to customize story outputs.
